# The Travis Wade Wiki

## About

This started off as a little side project as I wanted a stupid simple documentation site that I could use as a personal reference
location for things that I do that require a bit of extra research.  I then wanted to document these things to hopefully save
myself some time for similar tasks in the future.

Figured I'd make this public in the case that others run into similar projects / tasks / issues / gotcha's that folks could reference.

## Tooling

For this project, I use the following environments to build out this site and host it:

1. [VScode](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
2. [Github](https://github.com/travisnwade/docs.twade.io)
3. [MKDocs](https://docs.twade.io/mkdocs-help/)
4. [Netlify](https://docs.twade.io/netlify/)

## Hosting

I use [Netlify](https://docs.twade.io/netlify/) to host the static HTML that get's generated in my local environment.
