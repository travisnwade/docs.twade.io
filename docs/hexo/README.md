## What is Hexo?

Hexo is what powers [blog.twade.io](https://blog.twade.io). It's yet another static site generator
and done in my new favorite flavor of making websites, yes, it's Markdown.  Stupid easy. Write, 
generate, published on [Netlify](../netlify/) :).

## Getting Started

Getting up and running with Hexo was really easy.  I'm not even going to try to re-write my own
how-to for getting started with Hexo because their docs are very easy to follow.
