# Travis Wade Documentation Wiki

## How this site got started
### MKDocs
For full documentation visit [mkdocs.org](https://www.mkdocs.org).

## Where I host this
### Netlify
I host this site completely on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) on a free account. But that also comes with custom domain, free HTTPS. Which is badass!

There's no database to manage, just simple, flat files that I can write content using markdown, and one simple command that generates all static HTML files.

## Included documentation
### Commands

* `mkdocs new [dir-name]` - Create a new project.
* `mkdocs serve` - Start the live-reloading docs server.
* `mkdocs build` - Build the documentation site.
* `mkdocs -h` - Print help message and exit.

### Project layout

    mkdocs.yml    # The configuration file.
    docs/
        index.md  # The documentation homepage.
        ...       # Other markdown pages, images and other files.
