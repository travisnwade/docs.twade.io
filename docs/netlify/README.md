# About Netlify

Netlify is a kickass development tool and static file hosting service.  You can get started for free and you get a lot of features with it.

Essentially, it can take your existing repositories (I use Github for my personal projects), and can deploy, run builds and more. (such as `npm run build` and more during deployment
)
Which is all then served from their global CDN which is fast as hell!

And all I have to do is commit and push my code to the repo.  Netlify then deploys it automatically.

## My Netlify Projects
Here are a few of my projects that are hosted on Netlify:

1. This site!  [MKDocs](https://docs.twade.io)
2. My Links page (which is an open-source Linktree alternative): [links.twade.io](https://links.twade.io)
3. My CV site: [cv.twade.io](https://cv.twade.io)
4. My custom URL shortener site which is basically just a really easy redirect tool: [go.twade.io](https://go.twade.io)
5. Online Markdown Editor: [markdown.twade.io](https://markdown.twade.io)
6. Some website on the internet. Yeah, it's dumb. But it's also one of my very first Netlify projects: [somewebsiteontheinternet.com](https://www.somewebsiteontheinternet.com)
7. A very simple site that only says hello.  Again, another dumb little project I wanted to build out: [hello.twade.io](https://hello.twade.io)
8. An online book that I made for my children with some stories and other fun little things: [storiesfromdaddy.com](https://storiesfromdaddy.com/)
9. Fabric me this.  My wife's link page (using the same open source one I mentioned in bullet 2 above) with a fully functional contact form: [fabricmethis.com](https://www.fabricmethis.com/)
10. A super simple kids schedule. Not the most perfect, but looks nice on a TV in a common room that the children can reference for their daily schedule: [kids.tandj.io](https://kids.tandj.io/)
