I wanted a quick and easy Wiki style site that I could use as a personal reference to common tasks I do or things that took me a bit of troubleshooting to figure it out. Then I wanted to document it. I also didn't want to spend much money on it. (Free if possible). And I found MKDocs. Needs a bit of setup locally, but essently write your docs in markdown, then run a simple mkdocs build command to compile static HTML into a site directory which can then be published directly to Netlify's CDN. Free, easy SSL, and minimal overhead. All of which I fucking love. MKDocs For full documentation visit mkdocs.org . Where I host this Netlify I host this site completely on Netlify on a free account. But that also comes with custom domain, free HTTPS. Which is badass! There's no database to manage, just simple, flat files that I can write content using markdown, and one simple command that generates all static HTML files.
