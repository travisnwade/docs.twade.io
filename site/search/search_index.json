MKDocs My Links page (which is an open-source Linktree alternative): links.twade.io My CV site: cv.twade.io My custom URL shortener site which is basically just a really easy redirect tool: go.twade.io Online Markdown Editor: markdown.twade.io Some website on the internet. Yeah, it's dumb. But it's also one of my very first Netlify projects: somewebsiteontheinternet.com A very simple site that only says hello. Again, another dumb little project I wanted to build out: hello.twade.io An online book that I made for my children with some stories and other fun little things: storiesfromdaddy.com Fabric me this. My wife's link page (using the same open source one I mentioned in bullet 2 above) with a fully functional contact form: fabricmethis.com A super simple kids schedule.
